To create an industry-level event management website using a full stack Java approach, you'll need to focus on several key subjects:

### 1. **Project Planning and Architecture**
   - **Requirement Analysis**: Identify key features such as user registration, event creation, payment processing, and notifications.
   - **Technology Stack**:
     - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, or Vue.js)
     - **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot, Java EE)
     - **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB
     - **Version Control**: Git, GitHub or GitLab
     - **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or Digital Ocean

### 2. **Frontend Development**
   - **HTML5/CSS3**: Design responsive and interactive web pages.
   - **JavaScript Framework**: Use frameworks like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend. These frameworks allow you to manage the dynamic aspects of the website such as user interactions and event data rendering.
   - **UI/UX Design**: Use libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI to enhance the website design.
   - **API Integration**: Make RESTful API calls to communicate with the backend for features such as event data, bookings, and payments.

### 3. **Backend Development (Java)**
   - **Java with Spring Boot**: Spring Boot will help you build RESTful services quickly. Key modules to focus on:
     - **Spring MVC**: For routing and handling HTTP requests.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database access and ORM (Hibernate).
     - **Spring Security**: To manage user authentication and authorization.
     - **Spring Cloud**: If you plan to create a microservice architecture for scaling the website.
   - **Database Interaction**:
     - Use MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational databases or MongoDB for NoSQL.
     - Implement CRUD operations for managing users, events, bookings, and payments.

### 4. **Database Design**
   - **ER Diagrams**: Design your entities such as Users, Events, Bookings, Payments, etc.
   - **Relational Mapping**: Use JPA (Java Persistence API) to define relations between tables (e.g., One-to-Many for users and bookings, Many-to-Many for users and events).
   - **Database Optimization**: Indexing, normalization, and query optimization.

### 5. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **OAuth2.0 / JWT**: Implement secure login mechanisms.
   - **User Roles**: Define roles like admin, event organizer, attendee, etc., using Spring Security.
   - **SSO Integration**: If needed, integrate Single Sign-On with providers like Google, Facebook, etc.

### 6. **Event Management Features**
   - **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
   - **Event Creation**: Event organizers can create events, provide details (venue, date, time), and manage registrations.
   - **Payment Gateway Integration**: Implement payment systems using third-party APIs (Stripe, PayPal) for ticket sales or other fees.
   - **Event Search and Booking**: Users can search for events, filter by location or date, and book them.
   - **Admin Panel**: Create an admin panel for monitoring and managing events, users, and transactions.

### 7. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing**: Use JUnit for testing individual components.
   - **Integration Testing**: Verify that frontend and backend communication works correctly.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Use tools like Selenium or Cypress to ensure all features work as expected.

### 8. **DevOps and Deployment**
   - **CI/CD**: Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Travis CI to automate the build and deployment process.
   - **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize your application, making it easier to deploy on different platforms.
   - **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application on platforms like AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2), DigitalOcean, or Heroku.
   - **Monitoring and Logging**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring or ELK stack for logging.

### 9. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms like Redis to improve the performance of frequently accessed data.
   - **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing to handle high traffic.
   - **Asynchronous Processing**: Use Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven processing.

### Example Project Structure:
```
backend/
   src/main/java/
      com/eventmgmt/
         controller/
         service/
         repository/
         model/
frontend/
   public/
   src/
      components/
      services/
      assets/
database/
   schema.sql
   seed-data.sql
```

### Next Steps
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**: Start by setting up a multi-module Maven project for the backend and a React or Angular project for the frontend.
2. **Build Each Feature Step by Step**: Implement user authentication, event creation, and booking functionality first.
3. **Integration and Testing**: After implementing core features, perform end-to-end testing.
4. **Deploy to Production**: Use a cloud provider for deployment, ensuring your website is accessible online.
