1. What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logic having the capability
to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

2. Steps to develop JDBC application?

There are six steps are there to develop jdbc application.
1)Register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.
2)Establish the connection with database software.
3)Create statement object
4)Sends and executes SQL query in database software.
5)Gather the result from database software to result.
6)Close all jdbc connection objects.

3. Types of drivers in JDBC?

We have four types of drivers in jdbc?
1) Type1 JDBC driver (JDBC-ODBC bridge driver)
2) Type2 JDBC driver (Native API)
3) Type3 JDBC driver (Net Protocol)
4) Type4 JDBC driver (Native Protocol)

4. Types of Connection objects?

We have two types of Connection objects.
1)Direct Connection object:
A connection object which is created by the user is called direct direct connection object.
Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
Connection
con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE","system","admin");
2) Pooled JDBC Connection object:
A connection object which is gathered from JDBC Connection pool is called pooled jdbc
connectionobject.

5. Types of Statement objects?

Types of statements objects in jdbc:
Simple Statement Object:
It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Statement(I).
PreparedStatement Object:
It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.PreparedStatement(I).
Prepared Statment obj gives pre-compiled sql query.
Using this obj we can perform.
 We can set values to pre-compiled sql query for multiple times.
 We can execute pre compiled sql query for multiple times.
 We can gather the result from pre compiled sql query for multiple times.
CallableStatement Object:
It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements
java.sql.CallableStatement(I).

---

**6. Simple Statement vs PreparedStatement Object**

- **Simple Statement**: 
  - It is used to execute simple SQL queries without any parameters. 
  - Every time a Statement object is executed, the database compiles the SQL query, making it less efficient for repeated executions.
  - Susceptible to SQL injection if user inputs are directly concatenated into the query.

- **PreparedStatement**:
  - It is used to execute parameterized SQL queries. The query is precompiled and stored, making execution faster for repeated queries.
  - Helps in preventing SQL injection as it uses parameterized queries instead of concatenating strings.
  - It allows dynamic setting of input parameters using `setInt()`, `setString()`, etc.

---

**7. What is DatabaseMetaData?**

- **DatabaseMetaData** is an interface present in the `java.sql` package.
- It provides metadata (information) about a database.
- Information it gives includes:
  - Database product name
  - Database product version
  - Database driver name
  - Database driver version
  - Username used to connect to the database, etc.
- We can create a `DatabaseMetaData` object by using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  DatabaseMetaData dbmd = con.getMetaData();
  ```

---

**8. What is ResultSetMetaData?**

- **ResultSetMetaData** is an interface present in the `java.sql` package.
- It provides metadata about a table, such as:
  - The number of columns in a `ResultSet`
  - Data types of the columns
  - Size of each column, etc.
- We can create a `ResultSetMetaData` object by using the `getMetaData()` method of the `ResultSet` object.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
  ```

---

**9. Types of ResultSet Object**

- There are two types of `ResultSet` objects in JDBC:
  1. **Non-Scrollable ResultSet Object**
     - By default, every `ResultSet` object is non-scrollable.
     - It allows records to be read sequentially or unidirectionally (from the first row to the last row).
  
  2. **Scrollable ResultSet Object**
     - Allows reading records non-sequentially, bidirectionally, or randomly.
     - Can move forwards, backwards, or to a specific row in the result set.

---

**10. What is Batch Processing?**

- **Batch Processing** refers to executing a group of SQL statements as a batch.
- It helps in improving performance by reducing the number of database calls.
- In JDBC, batch processing can be done using `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement` objects.
- Methods used for batch processing:
  - `addBatch()`: Adds an SQL command to the batch.
  - `executeBatch()`: Executes all the commands in the batch.
  - `clearBatch()`: Clears all commands from the batch.

1. What is Servlet?

Servlet is a dynamic web resource program which enhanced the functionality of web server , 
proxy server ,HTTP server and etc.

2. What is web application?

Web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to 
generate web pages.
We have two types of web pages.
1)Static web page
2)Dynamic web page

3. What is web resource program?

We have two types of web resource programs.
1)Static web resource progra
It is responsible to generate static web pages.
ex:
HTML program
CSS program
Bootstrap program
Angular program
and etc.
2)Dynamic web resource program
It is responsible to generate dynamic web pages.
ex:
Servlet program
JSP program 
and etc.

4. Types of url patterns?

URL Pattern will hide technology name or class name from the outsider forsecurity reason.
Our web container, web resource program and client will recognize each servlet by using url
patternonly.
Every server is designed to support three types of url
patterns.
We have three types of URL patterns.
1)Exact match url pattern
2)Directory match url pattern
3)Extension match url pattern

5. In how many formats we can display the data?

6. What is web container?

 It is a software application or program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web 
resource program i.e from birth to death.
 Servlet container manages whole life cycle of servlet program.
 Similarly , JSP container manages whole life cycle of jsp program.
 Some part of industry considers servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

7. What is servlet Filter?

Filter is an object which is executed at the time of preprocessing and 
postprocessing of the request.
The main advantages of using filter is to perform filter task such as
1) Counting number of request
2) To perform validation
3) Encyrption and Decryption 
and etc.
Like Servlet, Filter is having it's own Filter API.
The javax.servlet package contains thre interfaces of Filter API.
1)Filter 
2)FilterChain
3)FilterConfig

8. Explain servlet life cycle methods?

We have three life cycle methods in Servlets
1)public void init(ServletConfig config)throws ServletException
It is used for instantiation event.
This method will execute just before Servlet object creation.
2)public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)throws
ServletException,IOException
It is used for request processing event.
This method will execute when request goes to servlet program.
3)public void destroy
It is used for destruction event.
This method will execute just before Servlet object destruction.

9. What is ServletConfig object?

 ServletConfig is an interface which is present in javax.servlet package.
 ServletConfig object will be created by the web container for every servlet.
 ServletConfig object is used to read configuration information from web.xml file
 We can create ServletConfig object by using getServletConfig() method.
ex:
ServletConfig config=getServletConfig();

10. What is ServletContext object?

 ServletContext is an interface which is present in javax.servlet package.
 ServletContext object is created by the web container for every web application i.e it is 
one per web application.
 ServletContext object is used to read configuration information from web.xml file and it is 
for all servlets.
 We can create ServletContext object by using getServletContext() method.
ex:
ServletContext context=getServletContext();
Or ServletConfig config=getServletConfig();
ServletContext context=config.getServletContext();

11. What is RequestDispatcher object?
12. Scopes of Servlets?
13. What is stateless web application?
14. What is state full web application?
15. What is session tracking and its techniques?

-----------------------------------------------x-------------------------------------------
1. What is JSP?

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology for developing Webpages that supports dynamic content. 
This helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, 
most of which start with <% and end with %>.

2. Servlet vs JSP?

Servlets JSP
To work with servlets strong java 
knowledge is required.
To work with JSP strong java knowledge is 
not required.
It is not suitable for non-java programmers. It is suitable for non-java programmers.
It does not support tags. It supports tags.
It does not give any implicit object. It gives 9 implicit objects.
Configuration of servlet program in 
web.xml file is mandatory.
Configuration of jsp program in web.xml 
file is optional.
Handling exceptions are mandatory. Handing exceptions is optional.
We can’t maintain HTML code and Java 
code separately.
We can maintain HTML code and Java code 
separately.
It runs faster than JSP. It runs slower than servlet because it takes 
time to compile the program and convert 
into Servlets.

3. JES class?
4. Types of tags in JSP?

Scripting tags
		i)Scriptlet tag
			It is used to declare java code.
		ii)Expression tag
		iii)Declaration tag 
2)Directive Tags
		i)Page directive tag
		ii)include directive tag
3)Standard Tags
4)JSP comment
5. Phases in JSP?

In JSP , we have two phases.
1)Translation phase
In this phase, our JSP program converts to JES class
(ABC_jsp.class and ABC_jsp.java) object.
2)Request processing phase
In this phase, our JES class will be execute and result will send
to browser window as dynamic response.

6. Implicit objects in JSP?

There are 9 implicit objects present in jsp.
Implicit objects are created by the web container that is available for every jsp program.
Object which can be used directly without any configuration is called implicit object.
The list of implicit objects are.
Object Type
out JspWriter
request HttpServletRequest
response HttpServletRespons
config ServletConfig
application ServletContext
session HttpSession
pageContext pageContext
page Object
exception Throwable

7. What is MVC in jsp?

MVC stands for Model View Controller.
It is a design partern which seperates business logic , persistence logic and data.
Controller acts like an interface between Model and View.
Controller is used to intercept with all the incoming requests.
Model contains data.
View represent User interface i.e UI.
9)What is JES class?
