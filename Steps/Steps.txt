### **Technical Questions**

#### 1. **Java and Spring Boot**
- **Can you explain the core concepts of Java and how they relate to the Spring Boot framework?**
  - **Answer**: Java is an object-oriented programming language that emphasizes portability, security, and performance. Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the setup and development of new applications by providing defaults for code and configuration. It allows for rapid development through features like auto-configuration and embedded servers, making it easy to create stand-alone, production-ready applications.

- **What are the advantages of using Spring Boot over traditional Spring?**
  - **Answer**: Spring Boot offers several advantages, including:
    - **Convention over Configuration**: Reduces the need for complex XML configurations.
    - **Auto-configuration**: Automatically configures the application based on the dependencies in the classpath.
    - **Embedded Servers**: Supports embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, which simplifies deployment.
    - **Microservices Ready**: Facilitates the development of microservices architectures.

- **How do you manage application properties in a Spring Boot application?**
  - **Answer**: Application properties in Spring Boot are managed using the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. This file allows for configuration settings like database URLs, port numbers, and logging levels to be defined easily. For sensitive information, I use environment variables or external configuration files to enhance security.

#### 2. **Database and MySQL**
- **How did you integrate MySQL with your Banking Management System?**
  - **Answer**: I integrated MySQL by adding the necessary dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for JDBC connectivity. I configured the `application.properties` file with the database URL, username, and password. I then used Spring Data JPA to create repositories for CRUD operations, which allowed for seamless interaction with the MySQL database.

- **Can you explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
  - **Answer**: SQL databases are relational and use structured query language for defining and manipulating data. They enforce a schema and are suitable for transactions and complex queries. In contrast, NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility in terms of schema and are often used for applications requiring scalability and fast access to large volumes of data.

- **What are some common performance tuning techniques you can apply to a MySQL database?**
  - **Answer**: Common performance tuning techniques include:
    - **Indexing**: Creating indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up search operations.
    - **Query Optimization**: Analyzing and rewriting queries to reduce execution time.
    - **Connection Pooling**: Using connection pools to manage database connections efficiently.
    - **Normalization and Denormalization**: Balancing between data normalization for consistency and denormalization for performance.

#### 3. **RESTful APIs**
- **What is REST, and how do RESTful APIs differ from traditional APIs?**
  - **Answer**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication. RESTful APIs are stateless and resource-oriented, meaning they focus on resources and their representations. Traditional APIs may rely on different protocols and may maintain state across requests, making them less scalable and flexible.

- **Can you explain how you designed your RESTful APIs for account management and transaction processing?**
  - **Answer**: I designed RESTful APIs using standard HTTP methods. For example:
    - **GET /accounts/{id}**: Retrieve account details.
    - **POST /accounts**: Create a new account.
    - **PUT /accounts/{id}**: Update existing account information.
    - **DELETE /accounts/{id}**: Delete an account.
    I ensured proper status codes were returned for each action and used JSON for request and response bodies.

- **What tools did you use to test your APIs?**
  - **Answer**: I used Postman for manual testing of the APIs, allowing me to send requests and analyze responses easily. Additionally, I implemented unit tests using JUnit and integration tests with Spring Test to ensure the APIs functioned correctly and handled edge cases.

#### 4. **Security**
- **How did you implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security?**
  - **Answer**: I implemented user authentication using Spring Security by configuring it in the security configuration class. I created a custom `UserDetailsService` to load user-specific data and used BCryptPasswordEncoder to encrypt passwords. For authorization, I defined roles and granted access to certain endpoints based on user roles.

- **Can you explain the difference between authentication and authorization?**
  - **Answer**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, often through credentials like username and password. Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do, such as accessing certain resources or performing specific actions.

- **What are some best practices for securing RESTful APIs?**
  - **Answer**: Best practices include:
    - **Using HTTPS**: Encrypt data in transit to prevent eavesdropping.
    - **Token-Based Authentication**: Using tokens (like JWT) instead of sessions for stateless authentication.
    - **Input Validation**: Validating and sanitizing inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implementing rate limiting to protect against DDoS attacks.

#### 5. **Development Process**
- **Describe your experience with version control systems like Git. How did you manage your codebase during your internship?**
  - **Answer**: I used Git for version control throughout my internship. I created branches for new features and bug fixes, ensuring a clean master branch. I committed changes with descriptive messages and regularly pushed updates to the remote repository. I also collaborated with teammates through pull requests, allowing for code reviews before merging changes.

- **Can you walk us through the software development lifecycle you followed in your projects?**
  - **Answer**: We followed the Agile methodology, which included:
    - **Planning**: Identifying requirements and breaking down tasks.
    - **Development**: Implementing features in short sprints.
    - **Testing**: Conducting unit and integration tests.
    - **Deployment**: Releasing the application to a staging environment for further testing.
    - **Review**: Gathering feedback and making necessary adjustments before the final release.

- **How did you approach debugging and troubleshooting issues during development?**
  - **Answer**: I approached debugging by first reproducing the issue to understand its context. I utilized logging frameworks like SLF4J to trace application flow and identify problem areas. For complex issues, I used tools like Eclipseâ€™s debugger to step through the code. I also collaborated with colleagues to gain different perspectives on the problem.
