JDBC
=====
As if know it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is also known a Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in a RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we ar making our applications writing the data into a file or database softawre.

File and Database software acts like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence
============
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important terminologies
======================
1) Persistence store 
------------------
	It is a place where we can store the data and manage the data for a long period of time.
	ex:
		Files
		Database Software 

2) Persistence data 
-----------------
	Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		Records 
		Tables

3) Persistence operation 
-----------------
	Insert, Update, Delete, Create , Select and etc are called persistence operations.
	In realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
	ex:
		C - create		S - select  
		U - update 		C - create 
		R - read		U - update
		D - delete 		D - delete 

4) Persistence logic
-------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
	ex:
		jdbc code 
		hibernate code 
		ibatis code 

5) Persistence technology 
------------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate 
		Ibatis 
		EJB 
		and etc.



Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.


Limitations with File as a persistence store 
----------------------------------------------

> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It stores unstructured data.

> It does not allows us to apply constraints.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> Updation and deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages with Database as a persistence store 
-----------------------------------------------
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is possible.

> It stores structured data.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> It allows us to show an application with relationships.

> Updation and deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.

Serialization
==============
	The process of taking object data and storing in a file is called serialization.
		
	Serialization means converting object state to file state.
	
	Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
==============
	The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.
		
	Deserialization means converting file state to object state.

	Diagram: jdbc1.2


Every JDBC application is a two tier application where java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2. 

Enduser is a non-technical person.He can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software.
Hence enduser depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

Diagram: jdbc1.3


JDBC Driver
============
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram: jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver 
===========
VBScript , Perl, D2K and etc uses ODBC Drivers to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver developed in C language by taking the support of pointers. Java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC Driver exclusively.


We will get JDBC Softwares from three parties.

1) Sun Micro System (creator of jdbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


We will get ODBC Softwares from three parties.

1) Xopen company (creator of odbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) third party vendor 


Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a open technology given by Sun Micro System having set of rules and guidelines to develop JDBC drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.
