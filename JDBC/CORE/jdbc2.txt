 Q) How many drivers are there  in JDBC?

We have four types of JDBC drivers.

1) Type1 JDBC Driver / JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver

2) Type2 JDBC Driver / Native API  

3) Type3 JDBC Driver / Net Protocol 

4) Type4 JDBC Driver / Native Protocol 


To use any JDBC driver we need to register with DriverManager service.

Every jdbc application contains one built in service called DriverManager service.


Class.forName()
================
It is always recommanded to use Class.forName() to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

It is used to load the driver class name but it won't create an object.

ex:

	Class.forName("driver-class-name");


Connection object
==================
Connection is a interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

It is used to establish the connection with database software.

Once work with database is completed then it is recommanded to close the Connection object.

ex:
	Connection con;


DriverManager.getConnection()
=============================
A DriverManager is a class which is present in java.sql package.

A getConnection() method is used to interact with database and returns a JDBC Connection object representing connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("url");


Statement object
=================
A Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Statement interface.

It acts like a vehicle between java application and database software.

It is used to sends and executes SQL query in database software.

We can create Statement object as follow.

ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();

ResultSet object
================
Every ResultSet object contains two positions.

1) BFR (Before First Record/Row)

2) ALR (After Last Record/Row)

By default record pointer points to BFR position.

Every record ResultSet having 1 as base index and every column of record ResultSet having 1 as base index.

rs.next()
---------
It moves to the next position from current position. 

If next position is a record then it will return true.

If next position is ALR then it will return false.'

To read the data from record ResultSet we need to use getXxx() methods with index numbers or column names.

Here getXxx() method means getInt(), getString(), getFloat(), getDouble() and etc.

Types of Queries in JDBC
=========================
According JDBC point of view we have two types of queries.

1) Select Query 

2) Non-Select Query


1) Select Query 
--------------
It will return bunch of records from database software.

ex:
	select * from student;

A JDBC Statement object gave executeQuery() method to execute select query.

ex:
	ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery("select * from student");



2) Non-Select Query
-------------------
It will return numeric value representing number of records effecting in a database table.
ex:
	delete from student;

A JDBC Statement object gave executeUpdate() method to execute non-select query.

ex:
	int result=st.executeUpdate("delete from student");

Steps to develop JDBC Application
==================================
There are six steps to develop JDBC Application.

1) Register JDBC Driver with DriverManager service.

2) Establish the connection with Database software.

3) Create a Statement object.

4) Sends and Executes SQL Query in database software.

5) Gather the result from database software to process the result.

6) Close all jdbc connection objects.



Type4 JDBC Driver / Type4 JDBC Driver Database properties
==========================================================

1) driver name 		:	oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

2) driver url 		:	jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE

3) database username 	:	system

4) database password 	:	admin 


JDBC API
========
API is a collection of packages.
ex:
	java.sql 
	javax.sql
	java.sql.rowset
	and etc.
