Steps to deploy war file in a Tomcat Server
==========================================
step1:
-----
	Launch eclipse IDE by choosing workspace location.

step2:
------
	Create a  Maven project for web application i.e DemoApp.

step3:
-----
	Add "servlet-api" maven dependency in pom.xml 

step4:
-----
	Add below code inside index.jsp.

index.jsp
---------
<center>
	<h1>
		Welcome to Java Project Development
	</h1>
</center>

step5:
------
	Set welcome file list inside web.xml file.

web.xml
-------
<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
 "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
 "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd" >

<web-app>
  
  	<welcome-file-list>
  		<welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
  	</welcome-file-list>
  
</web-app>

step6:
------
	Run the maven project.

step7:
------
	Convert dynamic web project(DemoApp) to war file.
	ex:
		right click to DemoApp project --> export --> war file -->
		select destination : desktop --> finish.

step8:
------
	Now start Tomcat 9 server manually.


step9:
-----
	Type below request url in broser window.
	ex:
		http://localhost:8080/


step10:
------
	Deploy the war file.




Limitations with Spring Framework
==================================
In spring framework a programmer is responsible for following things.

1) Adding the dependencies/jar files.

2) Performing the configurations (applicationContext.xml).

3) Arranging the physical servers i.e Tomcat.

4) Managing the database software i.e oracle or mysql.

To overcome this limitations we need to use Spring Boot.

ex:
	Developer ----------------> Spring Boot -----------------> Spring Framework


Spring Boot
============
It is a java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) features to spring based applications.

It is standalone , production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short Spring Boot is a combination of 

ex:
	Spring Framework  +  Embedded Server + Embedded Database

Spring Boot does not support xml configurations instead we will use annotations.


Advantages of Spring Boot
=========================
1) It is used to create standalone application which can run by using java -jar.

2) It provides production ready grade features like metrix, health check and externalized
   configurations.

3) It provides optionate starters to simplify the maven development process.

4) It allows us to test the web application by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow.

5) It supports in-memory databases like H2, HSQL, Derby.

6) It does not support xml configuration.

7) It supports CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to develop and test spring boot applications.


Interview Questions
====================

Q) How many components are there in spring boot?

We have four important components in spring boot.

1) AutoConfiguration 

2) Staters

3) Actuator 

4) CLI Tool 




Q) What is dependency injection ?

Dependency injection is a programming technique where one object will give dependencies of other.

Dependency injection is a programming technique which makes our class independent to it's dependency.

To perform dependency injection in spring boot we need to use @Autowired annotation.

ex:
	class Recordings
	{
	
	}
	class  Student
	{
		@Autowired
		Recordings record;
	}

Q) Where we will perform configurations in spring boot?

We we have two files in spring boot to perform configurations.

1) application.properties 

	or 

2) application.yml 


Q) In how many we can develop spring boot project?

There are two ways to develop spring boot project.

1) Using Spring Intializr

2) Using IDE's	(STS , Intellij)


STS IDE
